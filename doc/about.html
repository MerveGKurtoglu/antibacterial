<h2 id="GUI_overview"><strong>The Antibacterial Effect of Electrical Potential in Multi-Bacterial Systems</strong></h2>


<h2><strong>Model Microenvironment</strong></h2>

<p>
Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus form a bacterial infection in wound environments. Electrical potential as a 2-D gradient is implemented on the wound area to prevent bacterial growth by altering the secretion of quorum sensing factors, especially rhlr and lasR factors. Bacteria and quorum sensing factors are implemented as cell types in the PhysiCell simulation. Electrical field is imported as a csv file which is obtained by COMSOL Multiphysics simulations.
The Pseudomonas Aeruginosa bacteria secrete a quorum factor that diffuses at 70,000 micron^2/min. The max apoptosis rate is set to 5.31667e-03. The Staphylococcus bacteria secrete a quorum factor that diffuses at 35,000 micron^2/min. The max apoptosis rate is set to 5.31667e-05. Both bacteria secrete their factors at the same rate but Pseudomonas Aeruginosa uptakes its factor twice as fast.

<h2><strong>Model Microenvironment</strong></h2>
<p>The overall exploration of this model is to observe the change in bacterial population over time. The effect of quorum sensing in both bacteria will be analyzed in a fashion that each quorum factor affects one or both of the bacteria in a different way and the competitive results may be seen. Electrical potential gradient is created as defined for each voxel and this value is integrated to the secretion of these two factors ; therefore, we will be able to analyze the potential effect on bacterial growth on our microenvironment. We can also analyze a bacteria safe zone according to the gradient change in electrical potential. How different bacteria types may affect this change will be analyzed. Density and spread of bacteria types as time evolves with graphical output.</p>

<h2><strong>Scientific Background</strong></h2>
<p>A bacterial biofilm occurs when a community of bacteria come together to surround and attach to living and nonliving surfaces. This is significant as often the formation of a bacterial biofilm is representative of a major health and medical risk. Bacterial biofilms are particularly dangerous because they are invisible and highly resistant to antibiotics, antibodies and antimicrobials. On top of these characteristics bacterial biofilms form incredibly quickly on open wounds and are considered amongst the wider medical community as the most significant deterrent in the wound healing process as they often elicit chronic inflammation. In especially vulnerable patients (elderly, diabetics, and the immunocompromised) bacterial biofilms may lead to amputation.

A potential solution that this paper looks into is the potential difference between two metal electrodes and the galvanic effect that is a well-studied electrochemical phenomenon that creates an efficient antibacterial effect. This model's aim is to simulate the antibacterial effect of an electrical potential on multiple bacterial populations and observe the decay in population growth. We also aim to see how different type of bacteria will affect the same potential field and how they affect each other in terms of growth inhibition and occupying the microenvironment, and the efficient electrical field in terms of measurable dimensions as bacterial free areas.

<h2><a id="instructions" name="instructions">Key Parameters</a></h2>
<p>For both quorum sensing factor which affect both bacteria type:
<ul><li>secreation rate</li>
<li>death rate</li>
<li>diffusion coefficient</li>
<li>uptake_rate</li></ul></p>

<h2><a id="instructions" name="instructions">Baseline of the Model </a></h2>
<p>This model shows the manipulated bacterial growth by applied electrical potential to the microenvironment as chaninging gradient. Cut off behaviour by electrical potential shows the inhibition of bacterial growth in a certain potential threshold which allows to observe bacteria free area selectively.Behaviour of both Pseudomonas Aeroginosa and Staphylococcus Aureus can be observed based on different secretion rates of quorum sensing factors which are manipulated by electrical potential gradient.<p>

<h2><a id="instructions" name="instructions">Suggested Model Run</a></h2>

<p><ul><li>Secretion rate between 0.05-0.125 will show you different survival rate of bacteria</li>
<li>Changing the diffusion coefficient to low values (500 or less) or lowering the decay rate changes the locality of the effect.</li>
<li>The potential threshold from 0.08 to 0.13 alters what regions bacteria survive in.</li>
<li>Changing the adhesion distances to be larger causes more bacteria to die because they canâ€™t sense their neighbors</li>
