<h2 id="GUI_overview"><strong>The Antibacterial Effect of Electrical Potential in Multi-Bacterial Systems
</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Model Microenvironment</strong></h2>
</p>
Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus form a bacterial infection in wound environments. Electrical potential as a 2-D gradient is implemented on the wound area to prevent bacterial growth by altering the secretion of quorum sensing factors, especially rhlr and lasR factors. Bacteria and quorum sensing factors are implemented as cell types in the PhysiCell simulation. Electrical field is imported as a csv file which is obtained by COMSOL Multiphysics simulations. 
</p>
</p>
The Pseudomonas Aeruginosa bacteria secrete a quorum factor that diffuses at 70,000 micron^2/min. The max apoptosis rate is set to 5.31667e-03. The Staphylococcus bacteria secrete a quorum factor that diffuses at 35,000 micron^2/min. The max apoptosis rate is set to 5.31667e-05. Both bacteria secrete their factors at the same rate but Pseudomonas Aeruginosa uptakes its factor twice as fast.

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>

<p>
The overall exploration of this model is to observe the change in bacterial population over time. The effect of quorum sensing in both bacteria will be analyzed in a fashion that each quorum factor affects one or both of the bacteria in a different way and the competitive results may be seen. Electrical potential gradient is created as defined for each voxel and this value is integrated to the secretion of these two factors ; therefore, we will be able to analyze the potential effect on bacterial growth on our microenvironment. We can also analyze a bacteria safe zone according to the gradient change in electrical potential. How different bacteria types may affect this change will be analyzed. Density and spread of bacteria types as time evolves with graphical output.

<h2><strong>Scientific Background</strong></h2>

<p>
A bacterial biofilm occurs when a community of bacteria come together to surround and attach to living and nonliving surfaces. This is significant as often the formation of a bacterial biofilm is representative of a major health and medical risk. Bacterial biofilms are particularly dangerous because they are invisible and highly resistant to antibiotics, antibodies and antimicrobials. On top of these characteristics bacterial biofilms form incredibly quickly on open wounds and are considered amongst the wider medical community as the most significant deterrent in the wound healing process as they often elicit chronic inflammation. In especially vulnerable patients (elderly, diabetics, and the immunocompromised) bacterial biofilms may lead to amputation.
</p>

</p>
A potential solution that this paper looks into is the potential difference between two metal electrodes and the galvanic effect that is a well-studied electrochemical phenomenon that creates an efficient antibacterial effect. This model's aim is to simulate the antibacterial effect of an electrical potential on multiple bacterial populations and observe the decay in population growth. We also aim to see how different type of bacteria will affect the same potential field and how they affect each other in terms of growth inhibition and occupying the microenvironment, and the efficient electrical field in terms of measurable dimensions as bacterial free areas.

    <li><b>Config Basics</b> tab:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  input parameters common to all models (e.g., domain grid, simulation time, choice/frequency of outputs)</li>

Clicking the 'Run' button will use the specified parameters and start a simulation. When clicked, it creates an "Output" widget
that can be clicked/expanded to reveal the progress (text) of the simulation. When the simulation generates output files,
they can be visualized in the "Out: Plots" tab. The "# cell frames" will be dynamically updated 
as those output files are generated by the running simulation. When the "Run" button is clicked, it toggles to a "Cancel" button
that will terminate (not pause) the simulation.

<h2><strong>Key Parameters</strong></h2>
</p>
For both quorum sensing factor which affect both bacteria type:
<ul>
<li>secreation rate</li>
<li>death rate</li>
<li>diffusion coefficient</li>
<li>uptake_rate</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2><strong>Suggested Model Runs</strong></h2>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Secreation rate of both quorum factor and death rate of both bacteria type will show which bacteria will be dominant on bacterial growth in microenvironment. User can play with these parameters to see a competition between two bacteria type about bacterial growth which is led by quorum sensing signalling in between.</li>
<li>Diffusion of the factors is also a second parameter which can be analyzed for bacterial growth in multi bacterial system.</li>
<li>Default run will show you same diffusion rate for both quoruom sensing factors as 10000. Cell type 1 secretes factor 1 with 0.05 secretion rate and 0.2 uptake rate. Cell type 2 secretes factor 2 with same secretion rate but 2 times lower uptake rate.</li>
<li>Second run may be suggested with as change secretion rate of factors with 1/5 ratio or change uptake rate rates with 1/5 ratio or change diffusion of fators 1/5 ratio.</li>
</ol>


<p>Modify parameters in the &quot;Config Basics&quot;, &quot;Microenvironment&quot;, &quot;User Params&quot;, or &quot;Cell Types&quot; tabs. Click the &quot;Run&quot; button once you are ready.</p>

<p>To view the output results, click the &quot;Out: Plots&quot; tab, and move the slider bar to advance through simulation frames. 
Note that as the simulation runs, the &quot;# cell frames&quot; field will increase, so you can view more simulation frames.</p>

<p>If there are multiple substrates defined in the Microenvironment, you can select a different one from the drop-down widget in the Plots tab. You can also fix the colormap range of values.</p>

<p>Note that you can download full simulation data for further exploration in your tools of choice.</p>
